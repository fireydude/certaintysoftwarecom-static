===========================

A very basic company website.  

Initially the idea with this site was to try out the Twitter Bootstrap UI.
This framework provides some themes and basic client-side programming components.
For example, the carolsel on the About Me tab was created with a Bootstrap component.

Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------
The tabs and the drop down function on the Work Experience section have also 
been created using Bootstrap.  

Structure
---------
As the website is static
it could be hosted on AWS for free.  I have separated the different sections
into different files which are loaded using the jQuery load method.


Contact Form
------------
As the website is static I need to use an external website to provide the
Contact form so that I could be contacted without making my email address public.
I could have used used Google Forms but I decided to use Podio.
Podio is a project management tool which has a feature which provides free forms.
The Podio form is rendered by some javascript which is copied from the Podio
site.
